##Create a new project from scratch, with a new repository

1. Create a Public Repository on GitHub. Don't initialize it with anything.
2. Create a new project in Meteor.
3. In a Cloud 9 terminal:


        git init
        git remote add origin https://github.com/deejaybb/badidea.git
        git status
        git add -A
        git commit -m "Initial Commit or put whatever your commiting here"
        git push 

Repeat the last 4 commands everytime you add a feature or fix a bug. 


Change the remote URL based on what it says in your GitHub repository

'git init': initializes the local repository 

'git remote add origin': connect your local repository to a remote repository called 'origin'.
Copy the remote URL from your GitHub repository. 

'git status': see what the changed files are.

'git add -A': Add all changed files to the commit 

'git commit': -m "Initial Commit": Commits what you've done

'git push': Pushes your commits to GitHub
